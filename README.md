# Brief

This project analyzes Zomato data to extract meaningful insights about customer preferences and restaurant performance. The primary objective is to answer key business questions regarding restaurant types, customer voting patterns, ratings, and online vs. offline ordering behavior. By leveraging Python's data analysis capabilities, this project provides actionable insights to improve Zomato's business strategies.


# DataSet

The dataset used in this project is the Zomato Dataset. It includes details such as:

- Name: Restaurant name
- Online_order: Whether online ordering is available (Yes/No)
- Book_table: Whether table booking is available (Yes/No)
- Rate: Restaurant rating (e.g., 4.1/5)
- Votes: Number of customer votes
- Approx_cost(for two people): Approximate cost for two people
- Listed_in(type): Type of restaurant



# QuestionsAnswered
Through our analysis and visualization, we aim to answer the following questions:

1. What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?

2. How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?

3. What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?

4. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

5. Which ordering mode (online or offline) has received the highest rating?

Which type of restaurant receives more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide targeted offers?



# HowItWorks

- The dataset is loaded and cleaned to handle missing values.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to understand trends and patterns.

- Insights are derived to answer the business questions mentioned above.

- Visualizations are created to support data-driven conclusions.
